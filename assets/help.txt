Introduction

You are a Gravity Hunter patrolling deep space.
Planetary gravity bends every projectile you launch.
Master gravity physics to take down your enemies.


Controls

Aim (coarse): Left stick (ship faces stick direction)
Aim (fine): D-Pad Left/Right
Shot Power: D-Pad Up/Down
Modifiers: Hold L1 for smaller, R1 for larger steps
Fire: x

HUD

Red bar: Health
Green bar: Shot power
Yellow bar: Energy (auto-regenerates)
You need at least 20% energy to start thrusting.


Gravity & Scoring

Longer projectile flight time increases both damage 
and score.
Bigger planets exert stronger gravity.
Shots can travel slightly beyond the screen edges.


Tactics

Mix fast direct hits with slow, gravity-assisted 
trickshots for maximum points.
Minimize thrust usage - save it for dodging attacks 
or critical repositioning.

Press triangle five times in the campaign menu
